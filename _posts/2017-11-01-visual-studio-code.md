I thought I'd write a quick post about my recent experiences with VS Code.

For large, complex projects I still much prefer the power of a full-featured IDE with Webstorm being my current 
favourite. However for smaller projects, such as this site, I find a light-weight code editor usually does the job.

For some time [Atom](https://atom.io/) has been my go-to editor. I really like how extensible and customisable it is 
and it has a vast number of plugins and themes that can be installed.

I decided to give [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) a try after reading some
positive reviews and so far I'm very impressed.

It seems to make more assumptions about what you are going to do with it than Atom does. This meant I spent less
time installing packages and got straight down to coding. In fact so far I haven't needed to install any additional 
packages than those included out-of-the-box. Little things like minimaps, file icons and markdown previews were all 
available without having to download anything.

The Git integration is also pretty cool and looks like it works well but I still prefer to use the CLI to work with Git
as it's practically built into muscle memory now. There's a built-in terminal window though so I don't need to swap 
windows to do this.

The debugging tools also seem pretty powerful although again I haven't given them much of a try at this point. It's a
nice feature all the same. 

In terms of performance I'd say it feels quicker than Atom and I haven't had any stability issues. I have on occassion 
had Atom crash on me when performing certain tasks but so far haven't had any of these problems with VS Code.

All in all I'd recommend giving VS Code a try if you're looking around for a new code editor.
