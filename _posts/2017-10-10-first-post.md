This is the first blog post for my new site. 

It's something of a 'Hello World' to help me get my post pages set up and styled.

This is a simple static site built using Jekyll and hosted on Github Pages. I hadn't used Jekyll before so this was
a nice opportunity to try out a new technology and see what I could do with it. So far I'm pretty impressed with Jekyll
and the flexibility it gives you.

I'm also loving the simplicity of the deployment process. All I have to do is push to the master branch of my repo and
usually within minutes the updated site is live. At some point I'll likely set up a custom domain instead of using the 
default one Github assigns you, but for the time being I'm enjoying having a basic website which costs me nothing to
run.

A more detailed post on my setup should follow shortly...
