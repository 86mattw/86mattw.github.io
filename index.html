<h2 class="section-heading">What's this?</h2>

<div class="content-box">
  <p>
    This is a place for me to share my thoughts and experiences from working in the web development industry.
  </p>
  <p>
    It's also a space to collate useful information, tips and tutorials.
  </p>
  <p>
    The site is built with Jekyll and hosted on Github Pages. I'll be posting how I got it setup shortly (probably).
